# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

SnakeWeb

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A snake game that will be played on a webpage

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

My project will be a snake game that will be played on a webpage and as you eat more as the snake, the snake will get longer and bigger. There will also be stats on screen that will show how much you have eaten in the current game and the highest score achieved. There will also be 3 lifes or chances given for each game attempt. I will also try to use html and css to customize the game to the best of my ability. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A good outcome would be to have the snake game playable, where at least you can eat and the snake gets larger and dies when it touches its body or the walls. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A functional snake game that has customization from using css and html and a webpage that looks good to play the game in.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The best outcome would be to have a snake game that is similar to how snake.io is played where the snake would follow the mouse instead of the arrow keys.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

My next steps is to learn how to incorporate html and css with python to create the webpage first and customize the webpage. I would then have to create the field for the snake game to be played in. Depending on the size of the field, I might have to add obstacles and other things to make the game a little different from basic snake games.
