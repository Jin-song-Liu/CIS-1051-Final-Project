I have the basic features of a snake game done using pygame, I have the snake that moves according to the arrow keys and food that spawns randomly on the field, as well as the snake getting larger when touching the food.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I still need to customize and add other features such as obstacles, different foods that do other things beside making the snake larger, I am also trying to be creative and change how the game looks so far the snake and fod is just a box, I want to actually change the visuals of the game.
